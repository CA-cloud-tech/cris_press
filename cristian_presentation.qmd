## Quarto

Menudo mojon

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see `r 2+4` <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Library

```{r}
lapply(c("tidyverse","ggplot"), require, character.only=TRUE)

```

## Plots

```{r}
df <- starwars
plot(starwars$height)
```

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code


## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```
